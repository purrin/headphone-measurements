I will be providing only SBAF compensated measurements for now using the MiniDSP EARS.

The file naming conventions will be as follows:

The SBAF compensation using a MiniDSP EARS

This compensation is an attempt to have a straight line across as perceptive neutral. Read about it here:

Here is a spreadsheet for anyone with a MiniDSP EARS to calibrate it to the SBAF compensation. 
Note that all EARS units are slightly different. The spreadsheet contains a delta from my unit's provided HEQ.
In theory, applying this delta to your HEQ files should end with the same results here.

The 3.1 version with the removal of the screws is what I am currently using as of 8/1/2020
